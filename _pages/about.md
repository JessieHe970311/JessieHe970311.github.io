This is Jianben (Jessie) HE, a third-year Ph.D candidate at [VisLab](http://vis.cse.ust.hk/), the Department of Computer Science  and Engineering of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by [Prof. QU Huamin](http://huamin.org/) and [Prof. ZHANG Qian](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~qianzh/). My research interests lie in the intersection of data visualization (VIS), human computer interaction (HCI) and multimodal machine learning. I design and develop AI-powered interactive visual interfaces following human-centered design process to promote human-AI collaboration for multimodal data (e.g., videos) exploration, understanding and analytics.

Before joining HKUST, I obtained my Bachelor degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). 
I have visited Stanford University and the University of Hong Kong during my undergrduate study.
