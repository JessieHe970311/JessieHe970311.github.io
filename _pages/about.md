This is Jianben (Jessie) HE, a third-year Ph.D candidate at [VisLab](http://vis.cse.ust.hk/), the Department of Computer Science  and Engineering of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by [Prof. QU Huamin](http://huamin.org/) and [Prof. ZHANG Qian](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~qianzh/). My research focuses on developing visual analytics approaches, which seamlessly integrated computational algorithms with user-centered visualizations, to effectively support intelligent and insightful multimodal data (e.g., video) understanding and anlaysis.

Before joining HKUST, I obtained my bachelor degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I have visited Stanford University and Unidersity of Hong Kong during my undergrduate study. I also worked as research intern at Tsinghua University, where I was advised by [Prof. Zhang Chao](https://netsec.ccert.edu.cn/people/chaoz/) and [Prof. Wu Liji](https://www.sic.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1015/1246.html).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
